# README GENERATOR

## Discription

This challenge was a lot of fun for me.  I learned a lot about node.js and really enjoyed (what was frightening at first) working from the terminal.  I relied heavily on module 9 and set up camp on the NPM and MDN websites.  I reached out to some resources who helped me understand the power and simplicity of async / await functions.  I implemented this style in the "initialize function", and found it to be quite clean and efficient.  I used straight-forward questioning that focused on important details expected in a professional README.md. JavaScript, jQuery and Node.js were used to create my README Generator. When this application is initialized, user is presented with a list of questions that were created with npm "inquirer".  After answering all questions, a README.md is generated from a template that was created using JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this application, simply launch the computer's terminal, type "node index.js", and answer the prompted questions.  Each question will be assigned to it's respective placement in a pre-existing README.md template. The user will have the opportunity to add code snippets and screenshots in the terminal when certain questions prompt.  When all questions are answered, a "Success..." message will be displayed stating in which folder the README.md can be found.  Upon opening the README.md in Preview, the user will be presented with a well-organized, clean and professional layout.  Included in this layout is the colored badge, of the software license, the user chose from the query in the terminal.
